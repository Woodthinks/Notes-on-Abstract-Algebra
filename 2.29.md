# Chapter 2: Groups

### II Groups and subgroups

Consider some algebraic structures:
$F$ is a field, $GL_n(F) = \{n\times n \text{ invertible matrices }A\text{ with entries in }F\}$, with matrix multiplication $(A,B)\mapsto AB$ as the law of composition. $(GL_n(F),\times)$ forms a group. Usually, the group is called general linear group.

Take any set $T$, consider bijective mappings from $T$ to $T$ i.e. operators on $T$. Recall that bijective mappings have inverses. Then $(\{f:T\to T|f\text{ is bijective}\},\circ)$ forms a group, called permutation/symmetry group of $T$.

More speciafically, when $T = \{1,2,\cdots,n\}$
